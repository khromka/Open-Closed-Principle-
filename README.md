# Open/Closed Principle (OCP) in C++

This project demonstrates the Open/Closed Principle:
- Classes are **open for extension** (new shapes can be added).
- Classes are **closed for modification** (existing code does not need changes).

## Example
- Circle
- Rectangle
- Triangle

Run the program to see areas calculated polymorphically.
